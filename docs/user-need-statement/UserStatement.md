# Project Step 2

Overview

The purpose of this project is the development of an application to change the way voting is being conducted in the United States of America. The voting process that will be utilized is called ranked-choice voting. This application will be on a secure cloud-based system utilizing C# and ASP.net with uniquely issued Voter IDs and elections. This will maintain the security and integrity of all future elections.

Scope of Work

There will be two applications depending on the users intent. One application will solely be for the administrative side of creating a local election by adding the candidates that are eligible and running. The other application will solely be for verifying the identity of the user. The intended users of this application will have to apply for their uniquely issued Voter IDs. The information that will be required will be at a minimum an active driver's license and the state in which the election is being held. The application will allow users to create elections and monitor the results in real-time. The poll rating system will not be the traditional "one or the other" type of voting. The way the application will be utilized is by using ranked-choice voting. The voting for the candidates from a spectrum of highest votes to lowest votes. This type of voting is similar that the state of Maine utilizes.
