Project Step 3

## High-level Requirements

#MVP

At a minimum, the application will be utilizing Microsoft Visual Studio code to create an election. The election will include inputting however many candidates and however many votes. It will tally the votes in percentages. It will detect a &quot;draw&quot; if all the percentages are equal. It will declare a winner. Each vote will contain a tally of all the candidates in order of how it was inputted. For example, if &quot;Eric&quot; &amp; &quot;Jamie&quot; are inputted this way, then the votes will be read from left to right. The votes will be tallied by inserting each vote one by one.

1. Create an election
2. Input Candidate Names
3. Input Votes
4. Results displayed by Percentages
5. Displays who the winner is.
6. Detects draws

#Full

The application should have a nice easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) utilizing Microsoft Visual Studio. The GUI will be nice, bright, and colorful. It will be easy on the eyes to ensure the user will have a better experience to use on the application. Once the election has ended, the results will be posted at the end.

1. Easy-to-use GUI
2. Bright Colorful Interface

#Stretch

It would be nice to have an authentication section for the user and the candidates being implemented. A way to verify that the user is an actual voter of the age to vote. A way to verify utilizing a state drivers license or state ID. A verifying server would also be utilized to verify that the candidates are in the running in the local areas to ensure the input data is up to date. Another &quot;nice to have&quot; update would be a way to update the application every 15 seconds to ensure the data is the most up to date as possible. It would be nice to insert a timer to open and close the polls at a set time. It would be nice to have this application created on a mobile application that verifies that the user is of age and ensure the user is not a robot to ensure no voting manipulation. The application will be utilized on a computer system at a trusted company.

1. Verification Process
2. Always Updating application utilizing Real-time data.
3. Mobile application
4. Ensuring the user is not a bot.
