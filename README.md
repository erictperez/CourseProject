### The Idea

What is Ranked Choice Voting?

This process of voting allows the voters choose their choices in order of preference. It allows the voters to mark the candidates in the order of which they prefer such as 1st Choice, 2nd Choice, 3rd Choice, and so on.

## The Benefits

1. Promotes Majority Support
2. Discourages Negative Campaigning
3. Provides More Choices for Voters
4. Saves Money When Replacing Preliminaries or Runoffs
5. Promotes Relective Representation
6. Minimizes Strategic Voting
7. Increased Participation from Military and Overseas Voters

## The Project

What is VoterRank?

By utilizing the ASP.NET MVC & C#, I have created an application known as "VoterRank". This project was created in a span of 18 weeks. During this project, I wanted a safe way to conduct voting especialy during the COVID-19 pandemic times. Ranked-Choice voting is an interesting idea that I wanted to create into an application.
